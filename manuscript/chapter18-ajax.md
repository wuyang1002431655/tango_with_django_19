#AJAX in Django with JQuery {#chapter-ajax}

AJAX essentially is a combination of technologies that are integrated
together to reduce the number of page loads. Instead of reloading the
full page, only part of the page or the data in the page is reloaded. If
you haven't used AJAX before or would like to know more about it before
using it, check out the [AJAX resources at the Mozilla website](
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX).

To simplify the AJAX requests, we will be using the JQuery library. Note
that if you are using the Twitter CSS Bootstrap toolkit then JQuery will
already be added in. We are using [JQuery version 3](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js).
Otherwise, download the JQuery library and include it within your application i.e. save it within your project into the `static/js/` directory.

##AJAX based Functionality

To modernize the Rango application, let's
add in a number of features that will use AJAX, such as:

- Add a "Like Button" to let registered users "like" a particular category
- Add inline category suggestions - so that when a user types they can quickly find a category
- Add an "Add Button" to let registered users quickly and easily add a Page to the Category when they perform a search.

Create a new file, called `rango-ajax.js` and add it to your `static/js/`
directory. Then in your *base* template include:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	<script src="{% static "js/jquery.min.js" %}"></script>
	<script src="{% static "js/rango-ajax.js" %}"></script>


Here we assume you have downloaded a version of the JQuery library, but
you can also just directly refer to it:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

If you are using Bootstrap, then scroll to the bottom of the template code, and you will the JQuery library being imported at the end.
You can then add a link to `rango-ajax.js` after the Jquery library import.

Now that we have setup JQuery and have a place to put our client side AJAX code, we can now pimp the rango application.

##Add a "Like Button"

It would be nice to let user, who are registered, denote that they
"like" a particular category. In the following workflow, we will let
users "like" categories, but we will not be keeping track of what
categories they have "liked". So a registered user, could click the like button multiple times, if they refresh the page.
If we wanted to keep track of their likes, we would have to add in an additional model, and other supporting infrastructure,
but we'll leave that as an exercise for you :-).


### Workflow

To let users "like" certain categories undertake the following workflow:

- In the `category.html` template:
	- Add in a "Like" button with `id="like"`.
	- Add in a template tag to display the number of likes: `{{% category.likes %}}`
	- Place this inside a div with `id="like_count"`, i.e. `<div id="like_count">{{ category.likes }} </div>`
	- This sets up the template to capture likes and to display likes for the category.
	- Note, since the `category()` view passes a reference to the category object, we can use that to access the number of likes, with `{{ category.likes }}` in the template
- Create a view called, `like_category` which will examine the request and pick out the `category_id` and then increment the number of likes for that category.
	- Don't forgot to add in the url mapping; i.e map the `like_category` view to `rango/like_category/`. The GET request will then be `rango/like_category/?category_id=XXX`
	- Instead of returning a HTML page have this view will return the new total number of likes for that category.
- Now in `rango-ajax.js` add the JQuery code to perform the AJAX GET request.
	- If the request is successful, then update the `#like_count` element, and hide the like button.

### Updating Category Template

To prepare the template we will need to add in the "Like" button with
`id="like"` and create a `<div>` to display the number of likes
`{{% category.likes %}}`. To do this, add the following `<div>` to the
*category.html* template after the `<h1>{{ category.name }}</h1>` tag:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	<div>
	<strong id="like_count">{{ category.likes }}</strong> people like this category
	{% if user.is_authenticated %}
		<button id="likes" data-catid="{{category.id}}" class="btn btn-primary  btn-sm" type="button">
			Like
		</button>
		{% endif %}
	</div>


### Create a Like Category View

Create a view called, `like_category` in `rango/views.py` which will
examine the request and pick out the category\_id and then increment the
number of likes for that category.

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
	
	@login_required
	def like_category(request):
	
	cat_id = None
	if request.method == 'GET':
		cat_id = request.GET['category_id']
	likes = 0
	if cat_id:
		cat = Category.objects.get(id=int(cat_id))
		if cat:
			likes = cat.likes + 1
			cat.likes =  likes
			cat.save()
	return HttpResponse(likes)
	

On examining the code, you will see that we are only allowing
authenticated users to even access this view because we have put a decorator `@login_required` before our view. 

Note that the view assumes that a variable `category_id` has been passed to it via a GET
so that the we can identify the category to update. In this view, we
could also track and record that a particular user has "liked" this
category if we wanted - but we are keeping it simple to focus on the
AJAX mechanics.

Don't forget to add in the URL mapping, into `rango/urls.py`. Update the
`urlpatterns` by adding in:

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	url(r'^like/$', views.like_category, name='like_category'),


### Making the AJAX request

Now in "rango-ajax.js" you will need to add some JQuery code to perform
an AJAX GET request. Add in the following code:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$('#likes').click(function(){
		var catid;
		catid = $(this).attr("data-catid");
		$.get('/rango/like_category/', {category_id: catid}, function(data){
			$('#like_count').html(data);
			$('#likes').hide();
		});
	});

This piece of JQuery/Javascript will add an event handler to the element
with id `#likes`, i.e. the button. When clicked, it will extract the
category id from the button element, and then make an AJAX GET request
which will make a call to `/rango/like/` encoding the
`category_id` in the request. If the request is successful, then the
HTML element with id like\_count (i.e. the \<strong\> ) is updated with
the data returned by the request, and the HTML element with id likes
(i.e. the \<button\>) is hidden.

There is a lot going on here and getting the mechanics right when
constructing pages with AJAX can be a bit tricky. Essentially, when
the button is clicked an AJAX request is made, given our URL mapping,
this invokes the `like_category` view which updates the category and
returns the new number of likes. When the AJAX request receives the
response it updates parts of the page, i.e. the text and the button. The
`#likes` button is hidden.

##Adding Inline Category Suggestions
It would be really neat if we could provide a fast way for users to find
a category, rather than browsing through a long list. To do this we can
create a suggestion component which lets users type in a letter or part
of a word, and then the system responds by providing a list of suggested
categories, that the user can then select from. As the user types a
series of requests will be made to the server to fetch the suggested
categories relevant to what the user has entered.

### Workflow

To do this you will need to do the following.

- Create a parameterised function called `get_category_list(max_results=0, starts_with='')` that returns all the categories starting with `starts_with` if `max_results=0` otherwise it returns up to `max_results` categories.
	- The function returns a list of category objects annotated with the encoded category denoted by the attribute, `url`
- Create a view called *suggest\_category* which will examine the request and pick out the category query string.
	- Assume that a GET request is made and attempt to get the *query* attribute.
	- If the query string is not empty, ask the Category model to get the top 8 categories that start with the query string.
	- The list of category objects will then be combined into a piece of HTML via template.
	- Instead of creating a template called `suggestions.html` re-use the `cats.html` as it will be displaying data of the same type (i.e. categories).
	- To let the client ask for this data, you will need to create a URL mapping; lets call it *category\_suggest*

With the mapping, view, and template for this view in place, you will
need to update the `base.html` template and add in some javascript so
that the categories can be displayed as the user types.

In the `base.html` template modify the sidebar block so that a div with an id="cats" encapsulates the categories being presented. The JQuery/AJAX will update this element.

- Above this `<div>` add an input box for a user to enter the letters of a category, i.e.:
`<input  class="input-medium search-query" type="text" name="suggestion" value="" id="suggestion" />`

With these elements added into the templates, you can add in some JQuery to update the categories list as the user types.

	- Associate an on keypress event handler to the *input* with `id="suggestion"`
	- `$('#suggestion').keyup(function(){ ... })`
	- On keyup, issue an ajax call to retrieve the updated categories list
	- Then use the JQuery `.get()` function i.e. `$(this).get( ... )`
	- If the call is successful, replace the content of the `<div>` with id="cats" with the data received.
	- Here you can use the JQuery `.html()` function i.e. `$('#cats').html( data )`

### Parameterise the Get Category List Function

In this helper function we use a filter to find all the categories that
start with the string supplied. The filter we use will be `istartwith`,
this will make sure that it doesn't matter whether we use upper-case or
lower-case letters. If it on the other hand was important to take into
account whether letters was upper-case or not you would use `startswith`
instead.

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	def get_category_list(max_results=0, starts_with=''):
		cat_list = []
		if starts_with:
			cat_list = Category.objects.filter(name__istartswith=starts_with)
		
		if max_results > 0:
			if len(cat_list) > max_results:
				cat_list = cat_list[:max_results]
		return cat_list


### Create a Suggest Category View

Using the `get_category_list` function we can now create a view that
returns the top 8 matching results as follows:

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	def suggest_category(request):
		cat_list = []
		starts_with = ''
		
		if request.method == 'GET':
			starts_with = request.GET['suggestion']
		cat_list = get_category_list(8, starts_with)
		
		return render(request, 'rango/category_list.html', {'cat_list': cat_list })


Note here we are re-using the `rango/cats.html` template :-).

### Map View to URL

Add the following code to `urlpatterns` in `rango/urls.py`:

{lang="python",linenos=off}
	url(r'^suggest_category/$', views.suggest_category, name='suggest_category'),

### Update Base Template

In the base template in the sidebar div add in the following HTML code:

{lang="html",linenos=off}
	<ul class="nav nav-list">
		<li class="nav-header">Find a Category</li>
		<form>
			<label></label>
			<li><input  class="search-query span10" type="text" 
				name="suggestion" value="" id="suggestion" />
			</li>
		</form>
	</ul>
	<div id="cats">
	</div>


Here we have added in an input box with `id="suggestion"` and div with
`id="cats"` in which we will display the response. We don't need to add
a button as we will be adding an event handler on keyup to the input box
which will send the suggestion request.

### Add AJAX to Request Suggestions

Add the following JQuery code to the `js/rango-ajax.js`:

{lang="javascript",linenos=off}
	$('#suggestion').keyup(function(){
		var query;
		query = $(this).val();
		$.get('/rango/suggest_category/', {suggestion: query}, function(data){
			$('#cats').html(data);
		});
	});

Here, we attached an event handler to the HTML input element with
`id="suggestion"` to trigger when a keyup event occurs. When it does the
contents of the input box is obtained and placed into the `query`
variable. Then a AJAX GET request is made calling
`/rango/category_suggest/` with the `query` as the parameter. On
success, the HTML element with id="cats" i.e. the div, is updated with
the category list html.

X> ###Exercises
X>
X>To let registered users quickly and easily add a Page to the 
X> Category put an "Add" button next to each search result.
X> - Update the `category.html` template:
X> 		- Add a mini-button next to each search result (if the user is authenticated), garnish the button with the title and URL data, so that the JQuery can pick it out.
X>		- Put a \<div\> with `id="page"` around the pages in the category so that it can be updated when pages are added.
X> - Remove that link to `add` button, if you like.
X> - Create a view auto\_add\_page that accepts a parameterised GET request (title, url, catid) and adds it to the category
X> - Map an url to the view `url(r'^auto_add_page/$', views.auto_add_page, name='auto_add_page'),`
X> - Add an event handler to the button using JQuery - when added hide the button. The response could also update the pages listed on the category page, too.
