Getting Ready to Tango
======================

Let's get set up! To tango with Django, you'll need to ensure that you
have everything you need installed on your computer and that you have a
sound understanding of your development environment. This chapter walks
you through what you need and what you need to know.

For this tutorial, you'll require the following key pieces of software.

-   Python version 2.7+ or 3.0
-   Django version 1.9

As Django is a web application framework written in the Python
programming language, you will be required to have a working knowledge
of Python. If you haven't used Python before or you simply wish to brush
up on your skills, then we highly recommend that you check out and work
through one or more of the following guides.

-   **A quick tutorial** - Learn Python in 10 Minutes by Stavros,
    <http://www.korokithakis.net/tutorials/python/>.
-   **The Official Python Tutorial** at
    <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/>.
-   **A brilliant book**: Think Python: How to Think like a Computer
    Scientist by Allen B. Downey, available online at

    and Paul Gries at <https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1>.

Installing the Software
-----------------------
Now that you have a decent understanding of how to interact with the
terminal, you can begin to install the software required for this
tutorial.

### Installing Python

So, how do you go about installing Python 2.7/3.0 on your computer? You
may already have Python installed on your computer - and if you are
using a Linux distribution or OS X, you will definitely have it
installed. Some of your operating system's functionality [is implemented
in Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified),
hence the need for an interpreter!

Unfortunately, nearly all modern operating systems utilise a version of
Python that is older than what we require for this tutorial. There's
many different ways in which you can install Python, and many of them
are sadly rather tricky to accomplish. We demonstrate the most commonly
used approaches, and provide links to additional reading for more
information.

> **warning**
>
> This section will detail how to run Python 2.7.5 *alongside* your
> current Python installation. It is regarded as poor practice to remove
> your operating system's default Python installation and replace it
> with a newer version. Doing so could render aspects of your operating
> system's functionality broken!

#### Apple OS X

The most simple way to get Python 2.7.5 installed on your Mac is to
download and run the simple installer provided on the official Python
website. You can download the installer by visiting the webpage at
<http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7.5/>.

> **warning**
>
> Ensure that you download the `.dmg` file that is relevant to your
> particular OS X installation!

1.  Once you have downloaded the `.dmg` file, double-click it in the
    Finder.
2.  The file mounts as a separate disk and a new Finder window is
    presented to you.
3.  Double-click the file `Python.mpkg`. This will start the Python
    installer.
4.  Continue through the various screens to the point where you are
    ready to install the software. You may have to provide your password
    to confirm that you wish to install the software.
5.  Upon completion, close the installer and eject the Python disk. You
    can now delete the downloaded `.dmg` file.

You should now have an updated version of Python installed, ready for
Django! Easy, huh?

#### Linux Distributions

Unfortunately, there are many different ways in which you can download,
install and run an updated version of Python on your Linux distribution.
To make matters worse, methodologies vary from distribution to
distribution. For example, the instructions for installing Python on
[Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) may differ from those to install it
on an [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) installation.

However, not all hope is lost. An awesome tool (or a *Python environment
manager*) called [pythonbrew](https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew) can
help us address this difficulty. It provides an easy way to install and
manage different versions of Python, meaning you can leave your
operating system's default Python installation alone. Hurrah!

Taken from the instructions provided from [the pythonbrew GitHub
page](https://github.com/utahta/pythonbrew) and [this Stack Overflow
question and answer
page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5233536/python-2-7-on-ubuntu),
the following steps will install Python 2.7.5 on your Linux
distribution.

1.  Open a new terminal instance.
2.  Run the command `curl -kL http://xrl.us/pythonbrewinstall | bash`.
    This will download the installer and run it within your terminal for
    you. This installs pythonbrew into the directory `~/.pythonbrew`.
    Remember, the tilde (`~`) represents your home directory!
3.  You then need to edit the file `~/.bashrc`. In a text editor (such
    as `gedit`, `nano`, `vi` or `emacs`), add the following to a new
    line at the end of `~/.bashrc`:
    `[[ -s $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc ]] && source $HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc`
4.  Once you have saved the updated `~/.bashrc` file, close your
    terminal and open a new one. This allows the changes you make to
    take effect.
5.  Run the command `pythonbrew install 2.7.5` to install Python 2.7.5.
6.  You then have to *switch* Python 2.7.5 to the *active* Python
    installation. Do this by running the command
    `pythonbrew switch 2.7.5`.
7.  Python 2.7.5 should now be installed and ready to go.

> to directory-browsing tools, and are commonly used for configuration
> files. You can use the `ls` command to view hidden files by adding the
> `-a` switch to the end of the command, giving the command `ls -a`.

#### Windows

By default, Microsoft Windows comes with no installations of Python.
This means that you do not have to worry about leaving existing versions
be; installing from scratch should work just fine. You can download a
64-bit or 32-bit version of Python from [the official Python
website](http://www.python.org/download/). If you aren't sure which one
to download, you can determine if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit by
looking at the instructions provided [on the Microsoft
website](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions).

1.  When the installer is downloaded, open the file from the location to
    which you downloaded it.
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts to install Python.
3.  Close the installer once completed, and delete the downloaded file.

Once the installer is complete, you should have a working version of
Python ready to go. By default, Python 2.7.5 is installed to the folder
`C:\Python27`. We recommend that you leave the path as it is.

Upon the completion of the installation, open a Command Prompt and enter
the command `python`. If you see the Python prompt, installation was
successful. However, in certain circumstances, the installer may not set
your Windows installation's `PATH` environment variable correctly. This
will result in the `python` command not being found. Under Windows 7,
you can rectify this by performing the following:

1.  Click the *Start* button, right click *My Computer* and select
    *Properties*.
2.  Click the *Advanced* tab.
3.  Click the *Environment Variables* button.
4.  In the *System variables* list, find the variable called *Path*,
    click it, then click the *Edit* button.
5.  At the end of the line, enter `;C:\python27;C:\python27\scripts`.
    Don't forget the semicolon - and certainly *do not* add a space.
6.  Click OK to save your changes in each window.
7.  Close any Command Prompt instances, open a new instance, and try run
    the `python` command again.

This should get your Python installation fully working. Windows XP, [has
slightly different
instructions](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm), and [so
do Windows 8 installationsthis](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14224786).

### Setting Up the `PYTHONPATH`

With Python now installed, we now need to check that the installation
was successful. To do this, we need to check that the `PYTHONPATH`
[environment
variable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) is setup
correctly. `PYTHONPATH` provides the Python interpreter with the
location of additional Python [packages and
modules](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948494/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package)
which add extra functionality to the base Python installation. Without a
correctly set `PYTHONPATH`, we'll be unable to install and use Django!

First, let's verify that our `PYTHONPATH` variable exists. Depending on
the installation technique that you chose, this may or may not have been
done for you. To do this on your UNIX-based operating system, issue the
following command in a terminal.

```
$ echo $PYTHONPATH
```

On a Windows-based machine, open a Command Prompt and issue the
following.

```
$ echo %PYTHONPATH%
```

If all works, you should then see output that looks something similar to
the example below. On a Windows-based machine, you will obviously see a
Windows path, most likely originating from the C drive.

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages:
```

This is the path to your Python installation's `site-packages`
directory, where additional Python packages and modules are stored. If
you see a path, you can continue to the next part of this tutorial. If
you however do not see anything, you'll need to do a little bit of
detective work to find out the path. On a Windows installation, this
should be a trivial exercise: `site-packages` is located within the
`lib` folder of your Python installation directory. For example, if you
installed Python to `C:\Python27`, `site-packages` will be at
`C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\`.

UNIX-based operating systems however require a little bit of detective
work to discover the path of your `site-packages` installation. To do
this, launch the Python interpreter. The following terminal session
demonstrates the commands you should issue.

```
$ python

Python 2.7.5 (v2.7.5:ab05e7dd2788, May 13 2013, 13:18:45)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> import site
>>> print site.getsitepackages()[0]

'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages'

>>> quit()
```

Calling `site.getsitepackages()` returns a list of paths that point to
additional Python package and module stores. The first typically returns
the path to your `site-packages` directory - changing the list index
position may be required depending on your installation. If you receive
an error stating that `getsitepackages()` is not present within the
`site` module, verify you're running the correct version of Python.
Version 2.7.5 should include this function. Previous versions of the
language do not include this function.

The string which is shown as a result of executing
`print site.getsitepackages()[0]` is the path to your installation's
`site-packages` directory. Taking the path, we now need to add it to
your configuration. On a UNIX-based or UNIX-derived operating system,
edit your `.bashrc` file once more, adding the following to the bottom
of the file.

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<PATH_TO_SITE-PACKAGES>
```

Replace `<PATH_TO_SITE-PACKAGES>` with the path to your `site-packages`
directory. Save the file, and quit and reopen any instances of your
terminal.

On a Windows-based computer, you must follow the instructions shown in
Section requirements-install-python-windows to bring up the environment
variables settings dialog. Add a `PYTHONPATH` variable with the value
being set to your `site-packages` folder, which is typically
`C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\`.

### Using Setuptools and Pip

Installing and setting up your development environment is a really
important part of any project. While it is possible to install Python
Packages such as Django separately, this can lead to numerous problems
and hassles later on. For example, how would you share your setup with
another developer? How would you set up the same environment on your new
machine? How would you upgrade to the latest version of the package?
Using a package manager removes much of the hassle involved in setting
up and configuring your environment. It will also ensure that the
package you install is the correct for the version of Python you are
using, along with installing any other packages that are dependent upon
the one you want to install.

In this book, we will be using *Pip*. Pip is a user-friendly wrapper
over the *Setuptools* Python package manager. Because Pip depends on
Setuptools, we are required to ensure that both are installed on your
computer.

To start, we should download Setuptools from the [official Python
package website](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/1.1.6). You can
download the package in a compressed `.tar.gz` file. Using your
favourite file extracting program, extract the files. They should all
appear in a directory called `setuptools-1.1.6` - where `1.1.6`
represents the Setuptools version number. From a terminal instance, you
can then change into the directory and execute the script `ez_setup.py`
as shown below.

```
$ cd setuptools-1.1.6
$ sudo python ez_setup.py
```

In the example above, we also use `sudo` to allow the changes to become
system-wide. The second command should install Setuptools for you. To
verify that the installation was successful, you should be able to see
output similar to that shown below.

``` {.sourceCode .guess}
Finished processing dependencies for setuptools==1.1.6
```

Of course, `1.1.6` is substituted with the version of Setuptools you are
installing. If this line can be seen, you can move onto installing Pip.
This is a trivial process, and can be completed with one simple command.
From your terminal instance, enter the following.

```
$ sudo easy_install pip
```

This command should download and install Pip, again with system-wide
access. You should see the following output, verifying Pip has been
successfully installed.

```
Finished processing dependencies for pip
```

Upon seeing this output, you should be able to launch Pip from your
terminal. To do so, just type `pip`. Instead of an unrecognised command
error, you should be presented with a list of commands and switches that
Pip accepts. If you see this, you're ready to move on!

> **note**
>
> With Windows-based computers, follow the same basic process. You won't
> need to enter the `sudo` command, however.

### Installing Django

Once the Python package manager Pip is successfully installed on your
computer, installing Django is easy. Open a Command Prompt or terminal
window, and issue the following command.

```
$ pip install -U django==1.7
```

If you are using a UNIX-based operating system and receive complaints
about insufficient permissions, you will need to run the command with
elevated privileges using the `sudo` command. If this is the case, you
must then run the following command instead.

```
$ sudo pip install -U django==1.7
```

The package manager will download Django and install it in the correct
location for you. Upon completion, Django should be successfully
installed. Note, if you didn't include the `==1.7`, then a different
version of Django may be installed.

### Installing the Python Imaging Library

During the course of building Rango, we will be uploading and handling
images. This means we will need support from the [Pillow (Python Imaging
Library)](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). To install this
package issue the following command.

```
$ pip install pillow
```

Again, use `sudo` if required.

### Installing Other Python Packages

It is worth noting that additional Python packages can be easily
downloaded using the same manner. [The Python Package
Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) provides a listing of all the
packages available through Pip.

To get a list of the packages installed, you can run the following
command.

```
$ pip list
```

### Sharing your Package List

You can also get a list of the packages installed in a format that can
be shared with other developers. To do this issue the following command.

```
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

If you examine `requirements.txt` using either the command `more`,
`less` or `cat`, you will see the same information but in a slightly
different format. The `requirements.txt` can then use to install the
same setup by issuing the following command. This is incredibly useful
for setting up your environment on another computer, for example.

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Integrated Development Environment
----------------------------------

While not absolutely necessary, a good Python-based integrated
development environment (IDE) can be very helpful to you during the
development process. Several exist, with perhaps JetBrains'
[*PyCharm*](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and *PyDev* (a plugin of
the [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)) standing out as
popular choices. The [Python
Wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments)
provides an up-to-date list of Python IDEs.

Research which one is right for you, and be aware that some may require
you to purchase a licence. Ideally, you'll want to select an IDE that
supports integration with Django. PyCharm and PyDev both support Django
integration out of the box - though you will have to point the IDE to
the version of Python that you are using.

### Virtual Environments

We're almost all set to go! However, before we continue, it's worth
pointing out that while this setup is fine to begin with, there are some
drawbacks. What if you had another Python application that requires a
different version to run? Or you wanted to switch to the new version of
Django, but still wanted to maintain your Django 1.7 project?

The solution to this is to use [virtual
environments](http://simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial/). Virtual
environments allow multiple installations of Python and their relevant
packages to exist in harmony. This is the generally accepted approach to
configuring a Python setup nowadays.

They are pretty easy to setup, once you have pip installed, and you know
the right commands. You need to install a couple of additional packages.

    $ pip install virtualenv
    $ pip install virtualenvwrapper

The first package provides you with the infrastructure to create a
virtual environment. See [a non-magical introduction to Pip and
Virtualenv for Python
Beginners](http://dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/)
by Jamie Matthews for details about using virtualenv. However, using
just *virtualenv* alone is rather complex. The second package provides a
wrapper to the functionality in the virtualenv package and makes life a
lot easier.

If you are using a linux/unix based OS, then to use the wrapper you need
to call the following shell script from your command line: :

    $ source virtualenvwrapper.sh

It is a good idea to add this to your bash/profile script. So you dont
have to run it each and every time you want to use virtualenvironments.

However, if you are using windows, then install the
[virtualenvwrapper-win](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-win)
package:

    $ pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

Now you should be all set to create a virtual environment:

    $ mkvirtualenv rango

You can list the virtual environments created with `lsvirtualenv`, and
you can activate a virtual environment as follows:

    $ workon rango
    (rango)$

Your prompt with change and the current virtual environment will be
displayed, i.e. rango. Now within this environment you will be able to
install all the packages you like, without interferring with your
standard or other environements. Try `pip list` to see you dont have
Django or Pillow installed in your virtual environment. You can now
install them with pip so that they exist in your virtual environment.

Later on when we go to deploy the application, we will go through a
similar process see Chapter
Deploying your Application\<virtual-environment\> and set up a virtual
environment on PythonAnywhere.

### Code Repository

We should also point out that when you develop code, you should always
house your code within a version-controlled repository such as
[SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/) or [GIT](http://git-scm.com/). We
won't be going through this right now so that we can get stuck into
developing an application in Django. We have however provided a
crash course on GIT \<git-crash-course\>. We highly recommend that you
set up a GIT repository for your own projects. Doing so could save you
from disaster.

Exercises
---------

To get comfortable with your environment, try out the following
exercises.

-   Install Python 2.7.5+ and Pip.
-   Play around with your CLI and create a directory called `code`,
    which we use to create our projects in.
-   Install the Django and Pillow packages.
-   Setup your Virtual Environment
-   Setup your account on GitHub
-   Download and setup a Integrated Development Environemnt (like
    PyCharm)
-

    We have made the code for the book and application that you build available on GitHub, see [Tango With Django Book](https://github.com/leifos/tango_with_django_book) and [Rango Application](https://github.com/leifos/tango_with_django) .

    :   -   If you spot any errors or problem with the book, you can
            make a change request!
        -   If you have any problems with the exercises, you can check
            out the repository and see how we completed them.
