#Making Rango Tango! Code and Hints {#chapter-hints}

Hopefully, you will have been able to complete the exercises given the
workflows we provided, if not, or if you need a little help checkout
snippets of code and use them within your version of Rango.

##Track Page Click Throughs

Currently, Rango provides a direct link to external pages. This is not
very good if you want to track the number of times each page is clicked
and viewed. To count the number of times a page is viewed via Rango you
will need to perform the following steps.

### Creating a URL Tracking View

Create a new view called `track_url()` in `/rango/views.py` which takes
a parameterised HTTP `GET` request (i.e. `rango/goto/?page_id=1`) and
updates the number of views for the page. The view should then redirect
to the actual URL.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def track_url(request):
    page_id = None
    url = '/rango/'
    if request.method == 'GET':
        if 'page_id' in request.GET:
            page_id = request.GET['page_id']
            try:
                page = Page.objects.get(id=page_id)
                page.views = page.views + 1
                page.save()
                url = page.url
            except:
                pass

    return redirect(url)
```

Be sure that you import the `redirect()` function to `views.py` if it
isn't included already!

``` {.sourceCode .python}
from django.shortcuts import redirect
```

### Mapping URL

In `/rango/urls.py` add the following code to the `urlpatterns` tuple.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
url(r'^goto/$', views.track_url, name='goto'),
```

### Updating the Category Template

Update the `category.html` template so that it uses
`rango/goto/?page_id=XXX` instead of providing the direct URL for users
to click.

``` {.sourceCode .html}
{% for page in pages %}
    <li>
        <a href="{% url 'goto' %}?page_id={{page.id}}">{{ page.title }}</a>
        {% if page.views > 1 %}
            ({{ page.views }} views)
        {% elif page.views == 1 %}
            ({{ page.views }} view)
        {% endif %}
    </li>
{% endfor %}
```

Here you can see that in the template we have added some control
statements to display `view`, `views` or nothing depending on the value
of `page.views`.

### Updating Category View

Since we are tracking the number of click throughs you can now update
the `category()` view so that you order the pages by the number of
views, i.e:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
pages = Page.objects.filter(category=category).order_by('-views')
```

Now, confirm it all works, by clicking on links, and then going back to
the category page. Don't forget to refresh or click to another category
to see the updated page.

Searching Within a Category Page
--------------------------------

Rango aims to provide users with a helpful directory of page links. At
the moment, the search functionality is essentially independent of the
categories. It would be nicer however to have search integrated into
category browsing. Let's assume that a user will first browse their
category of interest first. If they can't find the page that they want,
they can then search for it. If they find a page that is suitable, then
they can add it to the category that they are in. Let's tackle the first
part of this description here.

We first need to remove the global search functionality and only let
users search within a category. This will mean that we essentially
decommission the current search page and search view. After this, we'll
need to perform the following.

### Decommissioning Generic Search

Remove the generic *Search* link from the menu bar by editing the
`base.html` template. You can also remove or comment out the URL mapping
in `rango/urls.py`.

### Creating a Search Form Template

Take the search form from `search.html` and put it into the
`category.html`. Be sure to change the action to point to the
`category()` view as shown below.

``` {.sourceCode .html}
<form class="form-inline" id="user_form" method="post" action="{% url 'category'  category.slug %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <!-- Display the search form elements here -->
    <input class="form-control" type="text" size="50" name="query" value="{{query}}" id="query" />
    <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit" name="submit" value="Search" />
```

> \</form\>

Also include a `<div>` to house the results underneath.

``` {.sourceCode .html}
<div class="panel">
    {% if result_list %}
        <div class="panel-heading">
            <h3 class="panel-title">Results</h3>
            <!-- Display search results in an ordered list -->
            <div class="panel-body">
                <div class="list-group">
                    {% for result in result_list %}
                    <div class="list-group-item">
                        <h4 class="list-group-item-heading"><a href="{{ result.link }}">{{ result.title }}</a></h4>
                        <p class="list-group-item-text">{{ result.summary }}</p>
                    </div>
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

### Updating the Category View

Update the category view to handle a HTTP `POST` request (i.e. when the
user submits a search) and inject the results list into the context. The
following code demonstrates this new functionality.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
def category(request, category_name_slug):
    context_dict = {}
    context_dict['result_list'] = None
    context_dict['query'] = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        query = request.POST['query'].strip()

        if query:
            # Run our Bing function to get the results list!
            result_list = run_query(query)

            context_dict['result_list'] = result_list
            context_dict['query'] = query

    try:
        category = Category.objects.get(slug=category_name_slug)
        context_dict['category_name'] = category.name
        pages = Page.objects.filter(category=category).order_by('-views')
        context_dict['pages'] = pages
        context_dict['category'] = category
    except Category.DoesNotExist:
        pass

    if not context_dict['query']:
        context_dict['query'] = category.name

    return render(request, 'rango/category.html', context_dict)
```

Notice that in the `context_dict` that we pass through, we will include
the `result_list` and `query`, and if there is no query, we provide a
default query, i.e. the category name. The query box then displays this
variable.
